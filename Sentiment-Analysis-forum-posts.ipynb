Even the most liberal japanese politican will disallow it while the most nationalistic japanese politician will block it till kingdom come. it doesn't matter who wants to sell or who wants to buy. The powers that be will block it. That's why Nvidia (A US company) acquisition of ARM (a UK Company) will likely fall apart due the aforementioned reasons.It's fun to discuss 'what if' scenarios but how about we discuss something there's some more plausible?

       "      <td>Disney wasn't worth much more than Sony's current valuation when they bought Fox for $71B.It would be more akin to a merger in execution (major Nintendo shareholders would likely receive compensation in Sony stock, key executives within Nintendo would likely be placed within comparable positions within Sony), but its entirely doable.Probably something like Nintendo's first party teams effectively replace and absorb Sony's Japan studios, continues to manage domestic distribution of hardware, software, and games development with a large degree of autonomy.The only major deviation would probably be Retro getting rolled in with the western studios, and pulled into their AAA production orbit.Not really practical though. Nintendo isn't a good value pickup for either one, unless MS wants to just stop Xbox as a hardware platform and instead run GamePass/XCloud with the Switch as the surrogate alongside PC and Android.Wouldn't happen though. If Nintendo acquisition was a real opportunity you'd have Apple and Amazon in the hunt and both would have incentive to outspend Microsoft substantially. If that tier of companies (therefore including MS) stayed out and we were only talking sub-$1T entities I don't see how anyone would outspend Nvidia, as the Switch is a posterchild for their hardware, the follow up will be an exceptionally good way to champion DLSS and Nvidia-only features, while only strengthening their position with third parties for marketing, Nvidia game streaming services, etc..But then, why would any Nintendo shareholders want to sell now? Their shares are up 50% YoY, 100% over ~3 years, and 400% over 5. Fox sold because Murdock wanted to cash out and did so at a premium because of a bidding war, not because of future market strength. Nintendo is a growth asset in a growth sector with remarkably stable cash flow and a very high floor.</td>\n",

I assume Nintendo would do well under Sony, not under MS based on history. If it goes south, I'd likely stop gaming as a main hobby.  \n",

It would literally never happen. Microsoft will leave console gaming altogether before Nintendo allows themselves to get purchased.But if it did, it would absolutely lead to a bunch of salt and hurt feelings  \n",

Nintendo is the only company bringing all sorts of fun & enjoyable games for everyone while both Microsoft & Sony cater to the hardcore crowd by being very obsessed with graphics & interactive movie games,  with Sony.  \n",

People would be disappointed at how poorly the company had been doing but probably optimistic they could turn things around under their new owner.  \n",

I feel like the competition benefit us, the customers. I'm actually curious if Ms didn't push BC, i wonder if Sony would have handled the ps4 bc differently on the ps5 by locking it behind ps now.  \n",

Nintendo's transitioned from just being a toymaker to being one of the bulwarks of an entire medium, and one of the short-hands for exported Japanese culture in generalLike, it's be apocalyptic. A genuine singularity. What comes after that point would look nothing like what went beforeI would probably be very sadBut the concept is, on its face in the current climate, patently ridiculous  \n",

Nintendo is considered one of them, so that would take Microsoft out. In national stuff, merges and acquisitions of public companies are only allowed in case one of the companies is bleeding money and doing really bad financially, so Nintendo would have to be bordering bankruptcy (at which point they would probably have stopped making games / consoles), so that counts Sony out.  \n",

I also think PC gamers would be happy to finally have native versions of any upcoming Nintendo releases. Not to mention Gamepass on Switch and better multimedia support on the Switch successor.If it were Sony, Sony fans would be happy to be able to get native releases of Nintendo games as well as possibly a new Sony handheld made by Nintendo. Kratos in Smash and all that Jazz.Anything else though (especially for Sony) is far to much of an unknown to really say for sure what would happen if Nintendo were bought out. Hopefully it never happens, because the industry doesn’t need any more consolidation.The one constant would be the immediate shock and then fear for Nintendo hardware as being available in the future, because love them or not they are always creative and fun. Under Sony, there would be a greater chance of Nintendo hardware continuing to exist but legacy content would likely be limited, whereas under Xbox the hardware would almost certainly be gone but the legacy content would be extremely accessible on modern Xbox hardware and services.It’s a nightmare either way though  \n",

As it stands sony could not afford to buy Nintendo. Microsoft could do it tbh but they would be pushing it. Last year mfst net profit stood at 44.3 billion USD (sure to rise in 2020) they could do a cash plus stock buyout. Or they could simply own a controlling interest. Idk what kind of regulations exist to prevent either from happening but anything is possible.  \n",

An adventure game that is the most cinematic of them all. Though the last released game is much more open and gameplay driven.The last of Us 2. An even bigger expansion on the ideas done in UC LL.Detroit. That I will give you.Horizon and Days Gone. That's just false. There is barely any QTE's and the cutscenes are not even that frequent due to the open world design that has tons of gameplay to do.  \n",

I really don't know how I'd react to something is literally impossible to happen, sorrynor Microsoft or Sony would accquire Nintendo, which is as big (or bigger) as them and they're not even 'for sale'.. that's just so much different of a singular publisher or studio  \n",

Probably wouldn't be a lot of change aside from seeing games that can run on Xbox being ported. I'd bet we'd still see a Switch style hardware still being made in conjunction with Xbox. You'd see a lot of cross platform releases and hopefully cross platform multi.Sony though? I mean it would be cool to see what Nintendo could do with the DualSense I guess. But suddenly the two big reasons for Nintendo being successful rn are gone. Price is now too high for the mass market/families by far and the handheld form factor is gone.Something would feel off with either purchase though.  \n",

More competition is good for gaming, and Nintendo platforms since the Wii have offered an alternative to Sony and Microsoft's models of services, hardware, in-house development, and marketing/partnerships.  \n",

I would assume this would mean Id get to play Nintendo games on relatively modern hardware instead of always being mad I have to buy another underpowered Nintendo console to play a few Nintendo games on.  \n",

But Nintendo won’t be sold because they are more important to japan economy than you think.  \n",

Their games and hardware are tailored for each other and I have no idea how Nintendo would work on hardware that isn't their own and Sega doesn't have the best track record of how a hardware manufacturer to software only can go. So... I'd be in utter shock and scared for the quality of the software.  \n",

It was closed by mods because it lacked effort.'s thread has a short OP with 3 short basic questions and a completely speculative premise. It couldn't have taken more effort than creating a 7 option poll although their OP IS a few sentences longer.Is there a minimum word requirement for OPs that I fell afoul of? I don't see an explicit one in the rules. Would be keen to know if anyone has any insight.Please send me a PM with any advice so as not to derail this thread. Thanks in advance.  \n",

Not to say most of it was factual.edit: was or was not? I am praising the book here.  \n",

Sony still publish games like Astrobot, Sackboy, Dreams all of which launched this year and none of which are remotely like the games you dislike I.e. games with a plot-led focus. If Sony acquired Nintendo (which will never happen) I don’t reckon they’d want to fiddle with the winning formula that much but would expand the IP to be used by some of the other studios perhaps. In other words, in this hypothetical, why buy another platform holder/publisher for such a large chunk of money to not play to their strengths? If it was the other way around Nintendo would want Sony’s studios because of their strengths for embedding plot-led narratives in their games as a big plus.  \n",

I wonder if down the road a 4th one will exist And if so, will it be in the MS/SONY bracket or the Nintendo bracket? the latter one focusing on portables like Nintendo  \n",

Because it would not be good for the industry.  \n",

Considering every 2nd home console puts them in danger of this - we'll have to see how the Switch U goes.  \n",

Mario goes home to drink and pop pills to forget. In the meantime Luigi bangs Peach.In another time and place, Link splits Ganon from head to crotch with the Master Sword, guts and blood spilling all over the arena. Then a slow, hopeless ending plays where Link walks slowly towards the ruins of Hyrule with his son.  \n",

If not completely then I'll only play retro stuff. Wouldn't buy any new consoles. Nintendo represents so much to me that those two companies would not respect our value. Now if they combine with Sony instead of some hostile takeover then I might keep my finger on the pulse. If Microsoft buys them then I'm completely out.  \n",

The PlayStation 4 is going to end up having sold what 120M? That makes it one of the most successful consoles ever. The PlayStation 5 has a huge amount of momentum and, as of now, is selling out everywhere at a pace higher than the PS4.The reality is that Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft are all doing quite well and there's not really going to be any dominating from anyone.  \n",

Don’t know how true that is and I don’t have the means to verify, so take it as hearsay.Nintendo is currently faar out of range of any buyout by any other player in the game business because of their large market cap, as others have said.  \n",

Oh and if it was Microsoft to buy I guess Nintendo games would be on PC. I don't play Nintendo games so not much of a reaction from me.Sega bowing out of the console market though? Nothing will top that experience. That was crazy. They had the 2k Sports games, Virtua Fighter, and so many other Sega stuff. What the heck!  \n",

If Nintendo were to sell the acquisition premium would in all likelihood drive things well north of $100B, which is frankly untenable for Sony unless we're talking a merger that would radically change both companies.  \n",

In the closing ceremony for the 2016 Olympics, Mario was used as a representation of  to symbolize Japan getting ready for the Tokyo Olympics.(@1 hour, 51 minutes, 10 seconds.

Like, if these are meant to be pure hypotheticals completely divorced from reality meant to serve solely as a though exercise, why is it always unidirectional?  \n",

And I shudder to think of the gifs that would come out of such an Event.I would like to be a fly on the wall in the alternate reality where this has already happened.  \n",

Sony would likely be the surviving entity (as they're bigger and already structured as a conglomerate) but Nintendo would undoubtedly become their core games unit and absorb SIE. The reality is what we'd from this would be less like \"Nintendo under Sony\" and more resemble \"PlayStation under Nintendo\". And I'm not sure the results of that would be what current Sony fans really want.  \n",

That's nice. But I would love an under the TV version that supports higher resolutions. Or, if the dock itself had more tech built in to do the same. Low res, low frame rates are not the type of diversity I appreciate.  \n",

Let Nintendo be Nintendo and just provide them the best chips and have them be multiplatform for the Switch, iOS and Mac. I don't know what the term would be, but they'd be like double or triple dipping. The current customer base would keep buying the switch for it's form factor and power.iPhone users would buy accessories to allow their phones to function like switches.Mac users who don't or haven't bought a Nintendo system would be able to play games, get a switch or iOS accessory iPad users would be able to enjoy a large screen portable system by linking a controller. They could even take a page out of Xbox's playbook and have their own back compat team work on updating titles so they can be enjoyed on the latest new chips so old games can hit higher resolutions and framerates on the latest hardware. Like Apple sucks at games, Nintendo would benefit from better chips and online infrastructure.  \n",

Nintendo prefers a centralized Japanese structure and while I can see them integrating much of SIE's R&D (particularly in areas Nintendo's lacking like network infrastructure, which currently they have to partner for) and some of their admin/marketing/regional offices, there's no way you'd see a semi-autonomous group existing alongside Japan like Sega West. SIE as we know it would be gone basically.  \n",

Nintendo's significantly larger and worth significantly more.I'm not sure we're ready for Nintendo making decisions on what happens with Steam.  \n",

I know Nintendo would never go for Valve's cut of their games, but even the first Nintendo game would sell 1 million the day it released on Steam.  \n",

If such a deal is ever contemplated They will probably spin off Xbox and have a friendly merger between Xbox and Nintendo and create a semi autonomous company they have a stake in that will work with MS on the big strategic stuff. That said looks like Nintendo has more links with Google currently than MS  \n",

That will be like Disney selling to Tencent or Alibaba. Will the US allows it? Even the most liberal japanese politican will disallow it while the most nationalistic japanese politician will block it till kingdom come. it doesn't matter who wants to sell or who wants to buy. The powers that be will block it. That's why Nvidia (A US company) acquisition of ARM (a UK Company) will likely fall apart due the aforementioned reasons.It's fun to discuss 'what if' scenarios but how about we discuss something there's some more plausible? Like....what if EA is bought by one of the platform holders and FIFA becomes an exclusive or something equivilant?  \n",

XBox would grow to dominate the Playstation.At that point, if you're MS you might as well yank Minecraft from Playstation just to finish the deal and consolidate the console market for yourself.  \n",

Even with Sony, things could turn very bad depending on the amount of mismanagement and inference. They would probably both milk and ruin most of the franchises. I could also see a massive developper exodus, with the old guard leaving.  \n",

Aside from obvious Game Pass tie-ins and cross-platform ports, I suspect Microsoft would probably just do like they did with Mojang and leave them to do their own thing. They'd probably throw out Nintendo's awful online infrastructure in favour of Xbox Live as the new backbone too.What Sony would do is a total question mark for me. Mostly the same thing I suppose.Neither outcome would be desirable.  \n",

       "45  Disney wasn't worth much more than Sony's current valuation when they bought Fox for $71B.It would be more akin to a merger in execution (major Nintendo shareholders would likely receive compensation in Sony stock, key executives within Nintendo would likely be placed within comparable positions within Sony), but its entirely doable.Probably something like Nintendo's first party teams effectively replace and absorb Sony's Japan studios, continues to manage domestic distribution of hardware, software, and games development with a large degree of autonomy.The only major deviation would probably be Retro getting rolled in with the western studios, and pulled into their AAA production orbit.Not really practical though. Nintendo isn't a good value pickup for either one, unless MS wants to just stop Xbox as a hardware platform and instead run GamePass/XCloud with the Switch as the surrogate alongside PC and Android.Wouldn't happen though. If Nintendo acquisition was a real opportunity you'd have Apple and Amazon in the hunt and both would have incentive to outspend Microsoft substantially. If that tier of companies (therefore including MS) stayed out and we were only talking sub-$1T entities I don't see how anyone would outspend Nvidia, as the Switch is a posterchild for their hardware, the follow up will be an exceptionally good way to champion DLSS and Nvidia-only features, while only strengthening their position with third parties for marketing, Nvidia game streaming services, etc..But then, why would any Nintendo shareholders want to sell now? Their shares are up 50% YoY, 100% over ~3 years, and 400% over 5. Fox sold because Murdock wanted to cash out and did so at a premium because of a bidding war, not because of future market strength. Nintendo is a growth asset in a growth sector with remarkably stable cash flow and a very high floor.  \n",

Other than that, it would be extremely negative and I would absolutely despise it.  \n",

I really believe they only started doing mobile games because of the terrible wii u years, and the reason they stopped is because they always hated doing so in the first place. I cant explain otherwise, an emulator with a subscription service on android would make them easy money every month.But for the hypotetical question: would be terrible of course. Anyone who isnt a fanboy knows that.  \n",

It started right when sega left the console business. The shock was so big that a lot of people speculate nintendo would do the same, since they are the only major manufacturer that does pretty much just videogames, unlike sony and nintendo. They are also the older ones in that market currently.  \n",

Still, kinda besides the point, as companies merge with others not *super* infrequently. Less common than an acquisition (although it should be said, there is no actual industry difference beyond nomenclature) but it happens.  \n",

Minoru Arakawa literally thought it was a joke. Some Microsoft employees talked about discussions between them and Nintendo about partnering together where they'd handle the networking and operating system while Nintendo built a console, but Hiroshi Yamauchi felt, \"They didn't understand the market\" and said no. Apparently they also went to Sony with a similar offer and were also told no. The rumour of Microsoft buying Nintendo back in 1999 for $25 billion has been going around for a long time.  \n",

Which Is why it doesn't make sense.  \n",

You simply cannot compare the advantages of Dualsense to: the Switch mechanism, Wii motion controls, the IR sensor in the joycon, Ring Fit, HD rumble the Wii U tablet, the Switch VR, Labo etc. Sony did give us dual sticks which is their biggest innovation in controller history and now their significant innovation is adaptive triggers.To say you want to see what Nintendo will do with the Dualsesne is a bit of an insult to their innovation. It's like giving them peanuts as a 3rd party dev. Without Nintendo many of the concepts in the Dualsesne wouldn't even exist.  \n",

There is no such law. There are changes to  for certain companies, but that isn't really going to be that big of a hurdle, as I went over here (and this is also what I responded to --R with on page 5):I am a tech/media centric mergers & acquisitions investment banker who often works on international deals, and I've been doing this for nearly a decade. While I am not a lawyer, I do have experience here; there are no laws like this.It's just...very Groundhog Day when this comes up literally every single M&A topic, and then every single page on that M&A topic. It's the same thing with \"they don't have enough cash\" or \"lets compare market caps\" (which is why I wrote that M&A primer topic I just quoted myself from up above there, but...)  \n",

I jokingly replied the biggest disappointment for some will be Nintendo doing very well in 2021 and threads like these proves the point.  \n",

I would love everything to be on one single console. So If in some hypothetical world were one of the companies could buy up the other 2 I would be all for it.  \n",

I'd love Gamepass with all Nintendo first party day one on my Switch and Xbox though, their games are so expensive all the time!  \n",

I sort of figured this whole Japan thing was kinda made up. A government not letting huge corporations do whatever they want in none security based industries? You can't make up this kind of sci-fi anymore.  \n",

I still play all my Switch games on a standard game controller. Wii was neat but I don’t want that again. Wii U sucked. For all Nintendo’s risk taking, in the end I’m still playing Mario and Zelda games on a standard game controller that mostly has the same buttons as the SNES.  \n",

I’m not a fan of consolidation and think all three of them bring a unique offering (or some unique offerings) to the industry. The more competition, the better things will be for consumers in the long run. Encourages innovation, too.  \n",

It was a year ago and pretty particular even when it was fresh! Lots of news to push it out in the meantime. I just hope that I can slowly improve Eras understanding of the inner workings of M&A, since it comes up so much. Always happy to answer questions, although I am bound from giving too much insight on the qualities of various theoretical deals.Don’t get my wrong, there is oversight, even for very large companies. But, as I lay out in my topic, the concerns are much more on the corporate/cultural side vs the government one.  \n",

That said, the industry would be far worse off without them.  \n",

They have their own innovations as well. And your earlier response reeks of, \"How dare they even suggest that\", when the statement wasn't insulting at all and you seem to be taking it too personally.  \n",

All of my favourites would be under one umbrella and I would only need one console and a pc to be able to play anything I wanted.  \n",

I am not putting them down. I am just critical of the notion Dualsense is so great that it overshadows Nintendo's decades of innovation. And that minor innovation warrants Nintendo becoming a Sony studio. My point is, it sounds like fanboyism. Let Soy and Nintendo do their won thing and the gaming world is better for that.I can understand people saying that they would like to see Nintendo working on the more powerful Sony systems but Dualsense is not that big of an innovation in comparison to even the other things that Sony has done. E.g. dual sticks.  \n",

Nintendo games would serve to benefit Sony or Microsoft's strategies.What's your fun answer?  \n",

I don't know. Maybe the perspective of having a console with good chances on Japan, and also having a good online infrastructure and support to PC Gaming would make everyone shocked at first, but then with good perspectives in the future. Overall, it would be a shock at first but in a long term that could be a overwhelming positive reaction in the future IF Nintendo continue with their independence.  \n",

Imagine this and this studio collaborating on this!”The reason this is fun to discuss is because it’s such a wild scenario we all know has a 0.01% chance of happening , but nah, you all have to get mad because someone suggested “what if someone’s favorite company bought someone else’s favorite company?”So for the third time now (or fourth time?), you guys are no fun.Seriously  most people decided to take offense rather than discuss the craziness OP proposed.

What I think would happen is actually very little that's worth discussion. Yes, if MS bought them, their games would come to Game Pass. Maybe Nintendo would make a Banjo game or something. That stuff is just obvious, and wouldn't be all that fun to me considering the downside.Downside aside? I don't particularly think anything insane would happen beyond the obvious. Go ahead and make that exciting fun post you keep asking everyone to make, instead of a template and constant whining about what others post?  \n",

I wonder if everyone would be equally offended at “What would you do if you became Nintendo’s President?”, would they also go “Well, that isn’t happening because this and this and that, ok?”.  \n",

I think MS would be better, because of their multi-platform approach (Nintendo games would be great on a Series S, and legacy Nintendo titles would be amazing if available on PC), but Sony would be fine too.I think local / remote game streaming will replace the need for Switch-like hardware, and I would love to not have to buy special Nintendo hardware.
